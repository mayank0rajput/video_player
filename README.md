# video_player
Hello Everyone , This is my first android project which I did as an assignment for my Android Development Course .
This Application is totally based on KOLIN and it uses some builtin android classes such as Media Controller and VideoView class.
Currently this application can play media and can perform operations such as play , pause, and seek forward and backward.
